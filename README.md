<h2>Favorite Project</h2>

My favorite project to work on was definitely 'filter-less'. It's an image filtering program written entirely in C. It first ensures the correct image format is found then, iterating through the image, performs the filter specific calculation (for instance the 'black and white' filter averages the rgb value of the nearest pixels) writing the final result to an output bmp file. This was my favorite because of how much it required thinking through each individual step the computer was taking. The biggest takeaway for me was a new appreaciation of the things that are more complex than they seem.

Note: Some programs may require dependencies found on Harvard's codespace and thus may not work properly. I have done my best to include all mentioned files.
