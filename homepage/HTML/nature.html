                    <p>
                        Iris is a genus of ~300 species of flowering plants with showy flowers. It takes its name from the Greek word for a rainbow, which is also the name for the Greek goddess of the rainbow, Iris.

                    <p>
                        Some authors state that the name refers to the wide variety of flower colors found among the many species. As well as being the scientific name, iris is also widely used as a common name for all Iris species.

                    A common name for some species is 'flags', while the plants of the subgenus Scorpiris are widely known as 'junos', particularly in horticulture. It is a popular garden flower.

                    <p>
                        Common names hydrangea or hortensia, is a genus of over 75 species of flowering plants native to Asia and the Americas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By far the greatest species diversity is in eastern Asia, notably China, Korea, and Japan. Most are shrubs 1–3 m (3 ft 3 in – 9 ft 10 in) tall, but some are small trees, and others lianas reaching up to 30 m (100 ft) by climbing up trees.

                    They can be either deciduous or evergreen, though the widely cultivated temperate species are all deciduous.Hydrangea is derived from Greek and means ‘water vessel’ (from ὕδωρ water + ἄγγος or αγγεῖον vessel), in reference to the shape of its seed capsules

                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Brunnera is a genus of flowering plants in the family Boraginaceae. They are rhizomatous perennials, native to the woodlands of Eastern Europe and North West Asia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They have hairy leaves and sprays of blue flowers in spring.[1] Numerous cultivars are available, which are valued as groundcover in dappled shade.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p class="text-left m-3">
                    Some possess variegated foliage. The best known species is Brunnera macrophylla, known as Siberian bugloss. It thrives in shade but also likes morning sunshine as long as it is in consistently moist, rich, organic soil. It does not tolerate dry conditions. It is often used in woodland gardens along streams of ponds and in naturalized areas as a specimen plant or clumped together as a border.
